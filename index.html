				<p>This is an <strong><abbr title="First-Person Shooter">FPS</abbr></strong> game that also has teams of 5 competing against one another. The goal is to win 16/30 rounds (and if there's a 15-15 tie, then there are overtime rounds). After 15 rounds are played, the teams switch sides. As the Counter-Terrorists, your goal is either to eliminate all of the Terrorists and/or diffuse the bomb. As the Terrorists, your goal is to either eliminate all of the Counter-Terrorists or to protect the bomb long enough for it to expldoe. I used to play this game somewhat competitively, but I'm not a member of any UGA teams; however, the UGA A team is actually performing quite well having won some of their matches 16-0 or 16-1.</p>

				<p> Destiny 2 is also an <abbr title="First-Person Shooter">FPS</abbr> game, but it's marketed as more of an <strong><abbr title="Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game">MMORPG</abbr></strong> due to the loot grind and open maps. Destiny 2 utilizes the same first-person perspective, but there is a dedicated campaign with side missions. This game only recently came out on PC, so not too many people have it for PC, but UGA is currently trying to start a Destiny 2 clan. By being part of a clan, players can get bonuses based on what their clanmates have accomplished. For instance, if someone JUST started the game, they would be able to get top tier loot drops if their clan finished certain difficult missions. In addition to this open-world adventure, there is Player vs Player. Once we get enough members, the UGA eSports Club will most likely try and create a Destiny 2 competitive team.</p>
